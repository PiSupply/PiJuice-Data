Resources for the [PiJuice Data range](https://www.pi-supply.com/?s=pijuice&post_type=product&tags=1&limit=5&ixwps=1) of GSM / 3G / 4G mobile data boards (complete with our revolutionary [PiAnywhere](https://www.pi-supply.com/product-tag/pianywhere/) technology â€“ the best way to take your Raspberry Pi off the grid!). Work both with the Raspberry Pi and standalone. Additionally have onboard WiFi hotspot and Bluetooth hotspot technnology and battery power and charging.
